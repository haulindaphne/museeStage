8Degree Fly Menu Lite is a free WordPress plugin that allows you to style your site with quick access navigation menu or easy information using an off canvas menu.

8Degree Fly Menu Lite makes use of the default WordPress menu function to create menus. You can add additional elements to the default menu items such as Menu Icons, Menu Taglines (short description), a pseudo grouping header and a long description. We have provided you with a WYSIWYG editor for your long description, so you can add almost anything here including shortcodes. Add header content and footer content to the menu or replace the entire menu with just quick information on the fly.
